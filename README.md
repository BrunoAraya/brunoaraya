### 🧠 About Me

I am a Master’s student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Chile with a strong interest in artificial intelligence applied to medicine. Currently, I am a researcher at **iHealth**, working on brain medical image segmentation projects, combining architectures such as **U-Net**, **Visual Transformers**, and medical-oriented models like **FastSurfer**.

### 🧪 Current Projects

- 🎓 **Master’s Thesis**:  
  *"Focal Cortical Dysplasia detection using Transformer- and CNN-based architectures on brain MRI."*  
  Implemented in PyTorch, with an emphasis on interpretability and efficiency.
